# Short description of simple Fuzzy-Logic example

The reason for that example is to demonstrate and explain how fuzzy logic works. I used therefore a very simple (and maybe not realistic) simulation of heating control. This simulation works not with fuzzy logic, but afterwards the fuzzy logic should handle this.

**Here I explain how the very simple simulation works (no fuzzy stuff):**
Outside temperature influences inside temperature (this means, that the inside temperature will be same like the outside temperature if no other influences will appear).
Radiator temperature influences also the inside temperature, but will be influences by inside temperature itself also (this means, if no other influences should appears, both temperatures will be come together).
The temperature of the radiator will be influences by the heating control. This means, depends on the setting, it will be more or less hot water get into the radiator, which also depending on the setting will influences more or less the radiator.
